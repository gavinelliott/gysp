<p>
  Additional screen before the declaration to give users
  a overview of the details they have provided within the
  service.

<h3 class="heading-small">Research notes</h3>

<p>
This feature tested very well - with users clear about what it was,
what they were reviewing and how they could change any details if required.
Participants would expect the change links to take them right back to the
relevant information then back to this summary page once it had been amended
although this functionality is not in the prototype. No users said they would
expect the bank details to be displayed on this page, with one user noting
their absence and most not noticing at all.
