<p>
  Week 4 of research in Darlington Library and week 5 in Gateshead.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Changes made</h3>

<p>
  Location in service returned to the same as week two in Leeds Library.
  Content changed regarding National Insurance number to see whether or not
  users understand they need to include this when sending documents.
  Removed the print and save option to reduce page length.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Research notes</h3>
<p>
  Darlington – big success rate; in service information helped and all participants
  completed the journey and sent relevant documents.
  Gateshead – the small content change to inform users of time scale increased
  expectations and caused confusion. Some users did not confirm they would send
  their NINO with the document.
