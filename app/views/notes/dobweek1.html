<h3 class="heading-small">First iteration</h3>

<p>
  Users asked to send documents at the beginning of the service immediately if
  they have not provided a date that matches our records.
  They can carry on in the service however their claim is not complete until
  they have sent documents to prove their date of birth.
  They were given a list of documents in this iteration, one from one list or two
  from another.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Research objectives</h3>

<p>
  To gather insight into users experience, understanding, expectations and behaviour
  in regards to providing their DoB and encountering the potential outcome of
  sending documents, and being faced with failure pages.
