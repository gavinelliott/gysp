<p>
  Week 2 of research in Leeds Library.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Changes made</h3>

<p>
  Two prototypes taken for research in this session. Both have the same content
  but in different points in the journey. Only primary documents requested from
  user to shorten the content.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Research notes</h3>
<p>
  Shorter information on Document page with less option appeared
  to work more effectively for journey completion. Those that complete understand
  the claim canâ€™t be processed until docs are sent. No issue providing DOB in service.
  No consensus on what will be sent alongside the documents (NINO).
</p>

<p>
  The DOB-FAIL screen requesting documents immediately after the date of birth screen.

<p>
  The DOB-FAIL screen requesting documents at the end of the service before the
  declaration page.
