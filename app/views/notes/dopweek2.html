<h3 class="heading-small">Research notes</h3>

<p>
Some users had considered deferring their pension though it was clear that few
of them would have made this decision at this point in the service. For the most
part they had made the decision not to defer prior to reaching this point and would
have known to come back later if they had wished to do so. As we have found before
most  users simply want their pension as soon as possible, and both those who had
considered but dismissed deferring and those who had never heard of it, were confused
as to why they would need to address a date of claim question in service. Some of
these users were uncomfortable with providing a telephone number as they would be
unwilling to discuss their finances over the phone without prior verification of the
callers identity. In addition contact via email would support the confirmation of
application as well as reassuring users who they are dealing with. Other issue
included the confusion of the Government Gateway service with GOV.UK Verify -
potentially leading to confusion - and the clarity around some content around date of claim.
