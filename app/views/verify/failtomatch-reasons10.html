				You have successfully verified your identity with a certified company,
				but Department for Work and Pensions was unable to recognise some of your details.
<br>
</br>
				This could be because:

				<ul class="list-bullet">
					<li>you have not reached your State Pension date yet</li>
					<li>you have already reached your State Pension date and we
						<br> do not hold your details</li>
					<li>you provided information that does not match our records</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				<h2 class="heading-large">How to get your State Pension</h2>
<br>
				<h6 class="bold">If you have not reached your State Pension date yet</h6>
				<p>You should receive an invitation letter no later than 2 months before your State Pension date.
					If you do not receive a letter by this time, you can sign in with your GOV.UK Verify account.


<h6 class="bold">If you have reached your State Pension date</h6>
				<p>You need to call us to get your State Pension. You will need your
					National Insurance number and to confirm some personal details.
